# Design: Themed presentations / decks

Status: **implemented** (build integration done; `<slide>`/`<splitslide>`/`<noslide>` markup, the
`slides.split` targets, bullets, the `slides.enabled` site/post config, publishing at `…/<slug>/slides/`,
the Downloads-box entry, the post-list marker, and no-JS degradation are all wired). Still rough:
true-offline bundling (inline images + pre-rendered KaTeX/Mermaid) is deferred; `text:` and `###→bullets`
are in. The `colophon deck <file>` CLI remains as a one-shot generator. Move to `docs/` when it firms up.

## Overview

Generate a **themed slide deck from existing post content** — a structural *projection* of a
post (or a standalone content file), not a separate authoring format. The engine emits semantic
HTML (one `<section>` per slide) and ships a JS **deck reader** (an engine asset, like
`player.js`/`glossary.js`); the active theme restyles the slides. The deck is **derived only** —
there is no separate "authored deck" markdown. Author intent is expressed with a few inline hints.

The guiding inversion: **slides are cues, speaker notes are the script.** Slides carry headings,
bullets, figures, math and diagrams; ordinary prose becomes the notes.

## Scope

In: derived decks from posts/standalone content; the split algorithm; the `<section>`/notes HTML
contract; author override markup; an engine `deck.js`/`deck.css`; reuse of the existing
math/mermaid/highlight/`gen:` pipeline and theme inheritance.

Deferred / out of scope (for now): speaker-note **summarisation** (notes = prose verbatim at
first); **own-slide vs alongside sizing** heuristics (the reader/theme handle layout); fragments /
incremental reveal; transitions beyond CSS; a native PDF exporter (use the browser's Print → PDF —
no Chromium dependency); an authored-deck mode.

## Activation & addressing

- **Attached to a post:** when slides are enabled for it, the deck is published at `…/<slug>/slides/`,
  linked from the post. Same source, two artifacts.
- **Standalone:** `type: deck` → rendered as a deck at its own slug.

## Config & scope (`slides:`)

`slides:` is configured at two scopes, narrowest wins:

- **Project / site** (`colophon.yaml` → `slides:`): the defaults for every post — `enabled`
  (whether posts get a deck at all), `split`, and any future keys.
- **Per post** (frontmatter `slides:`): overrides those defaults for one post, including
  `enabled: true/false` to force a deck on or off regardless of the site default.

```yaml
# colophon.yaml — site defaults
slides:
  enabled: false        # default off; a post opts in with `slides.enabled: true`
  split: [h2]

# a post's frontmatter
slides:
  enabled: true         # this post gets a deck even though the site default is off
```

`slides: true` / `slides: false` are shorthand for `slides.enabled: true/false` (with the other
keys inherited).

**Override is shallow / by key** — *not* a deep-merge (unlike generation profiles). A key present in
frontmatter **replaces** the site value wholesale (a `split` list is swapped, never element-merged);
keys the post omits **inherit** the site default. So a post can set `slides.split` without restating
`enabled`, and vice versa.

### Split targets (`slides.split`, a list)

| target | splits before… |
|--------|----------------|
| `h1` … `h6` | a heading of that level (the heading becomes the slide title) |
| `hr` | a thematic break (`---` / `<hr>`) — no title |
| `splitslide` | an explicit `<splitslide>` marker — no title |
| `image` | a figure / image |
| `table` | a table |
| `code` | a fenced code block |
| `math` | a display-math block |
| `diagram` (`mermaid`) | a Mermaid diagram |
| `audio` / `video` | an embedded media player |
| `text:<match>` | a block whose text **begins with** `<match>` — split on a recurring marker rather than structure |

**Default:** `[h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, splitslide]` — every heading (any level) starts a new
slide. Narrow it to make deeper headings fold into **bullets** instead: `split: [h2]` puts each `h2`
on its own slide and turns the `h3`s under it into the slide's bullet list. The showcase uses
`split: [h2]` so it lands one slide per topic.

## Split algorithm (derived)

Walk the rendered body; start a new slide at any boundary in `slides.split` (default: every heading,
`<hr>`, `<splitslide>`). When the boundary is a heading it becomes the slide **title**; the block
kinds / `hr` / `splitslide` start an untitled slide.

For each section:

- the **boundary heading** is the slide **title**;
- any **heading still inside the section** (below the split level) folds into a leading **bullet
  list** (`<ul class="slide-bullets">`);
- **prose paragraphs** go to the slide's **presenter notes** (the script), shown only in presenter
  mode — *not* the slide;
- everything else — tables, images, code, display math, Mermaid, callouts, pull-quotes, bullets — is a
  **block on the slide**. Prose is never in both places; a section that is only prose becomes a title
  slide with the narration in its notes.
- A **cover slide** (title, description, author avatar/initials + date) is prepended.

**Pagination (content-aware).** Blocks are packed onto a slide up to a line budget; when the next
block won't fit, it spills to a **continuation slide** (title marked "(cont.)"). A block heavier than
the budget gets its **own slide**; an oversized **code** block is **truncated** with a link back to
the post; **images/video** scale to fit (`max-height`). A JS fit safety-net scales a slide down if an
estimate still overflows.

**Hydration.** KaTeX, Mermaid and highlight.js load from the same published `/vendor` assets the
theme uses (no CDN), only for what the deck contains — so math, diagrams and code render, not raw
source. (Full offline bundling of these is still deferred.)

**Keys.** ←/→/Space/PageUp-Down navigate, Home/End jump, **Enter** plays/pauses the slide's audio or
video, **P** toggles presenter, **F** fullscreen, **Esc** returns to the post.

Class-styled blocks (`.callout`, `.pullquote`, tables, …) are emitted unchanged and **styled by
the deck theme**, which **bases off the active theme** (existing base-inheritance), so they look
right for free.

## Output contract

The engine groups the body into one `<section class="slide">` per slide. Degrades to a **readable
long-form document with no JS** (the talk reads as an article — SEO + a11y for free). Shape:

```html
<section class="slide" aria-label="Slide 3: Pull-quotes" id="slide-3">
  <h2 class="slide-title">Pull-quotes</h2>
  <ul class="slide-bullets"><li>…</li></ul>
  <figure class="pullquote">…</figure>          <!-- blocks render inline, themed -->
  <aside class="notes">…the section's prose…</aside>  <!-- presenter notes, hidden in slide view -->
</section>
```

The `<splitslide>` marker is the **one unifying break mechanism**: heading/`---` splits emit the same
section boundary the author would with a manual `<splitslide>`.

## Author overrides (inline markup, mirrors the `<tts>` family)

By default the engine **auto-derives** the slides. These inline tags are deck-only directives — like
`<tts>`/`<notts>` for speech, they're inert in the post itself (the content renders normally there);
only the deck builder acts on them. The symmetry is exact:

| speech | slide | effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `<notts>…</notts>` | `<noslide>…</noslide>` | visible in the post, **excluded** from the spoken / slide output |
| `<tts>…</tts>` | `<slide>…</slide>` | **forced in** — read verbatim / made one explicit slide |
| — | `<splitslide>` | a structural slide break (no speech equivalent) |

- `<noslide>…</noslide>` — stripped from the deck only; stays in the post (the `<notts>` mirror).
- `<slide>…</slide>` — everything inside becomes **one verbatim slide**: an authored escape hatch
  from the derived split. A leading heading is its title; all other content (prose included) stays
  **on** the slide and is *not* pulled into notes.
- `<splitslide>` — force a slide break anywhere (a void marker; also the engine's internal break).

Note (for build integration): in the **published post** these deck-directive tags should be stripped
to inert like the engine does conceptually — at minimum they must never render as literal `<slide>`
text. (The current `<tts>`/`<notts>` tags pass through as inert custom elements; decks should match
or improve on that.)

## Engine assets & the reader

Shipped by the engine (consistent across themes; theme restyles only):

- **`deck.js`** — the reader: keyboard + swipe navigation, fit-to-viewport scaling, a `?presenter`
  view (current slide + next + notes + timer), URL/`#slide-N` deep links, and reuse of the existing
  math/mermaid/highlight hydration. (Fragments/transitions later.)
- **`deck.css`** — base slide layout/chrome; the active theme overrides tokens + look.

A JS reader **is essential** for the interactive experience — but it lives in the asset/theme
layer, so the **engine output stays markup-only and fully degrades**.

## WCAG AAA (required — see the `wcag-aaa-compliance` decision)

The deck — including the no-JS document — is AAA from the start:

- Semantic landmarks: `<section>` slides, `<aside class="notes">`, a `<nav>` for controls.
- **Keyboard-operable** navigation; a clearly **visible focus indicator** on every control.
- Slide changes announced via `aria-live` (e.g. "Slide 4 of 12: …"); focus moved to the new slide.
- `prefers-reduced-motion`: no slide transitions/animation when set.
- Text contrast ≥ 7:1; never convey state by colour alone; scale/zoom without clipping (the
  fit-to-viewport must not defeat user zoom of the notes/document view).
- Image `alt` carried through from markdown; figures keep captions.
- The presenter view and the printed/notes view are themselves accessible.

## Offline / downloadable deck

A presenter needs the deck to work **offline** (no network at the venue). Plan: a "Download"
control that produces a **single self-contained `.html`** — CSS, `deck.js`, KaTeX/Mermaid output
and images all **inlined** (CSS/JS embedded, images as `data:` URIs), so one file opens anywhere
with no server and no assets. The same file is the Print → PDF source. Two builds of the deck:
the normal published page (linked assets, cacheable) and an on-demand/downloadable inlined bundle.
Math/diagrams must be **pre-rendered** (or their libraries inlined) for the offline copy, since the
browser can't fetch KaTeX/Mermaid at the venue.

## Open questions

- How note **summarisation** plugs in later (reuse the audio/excerpt derivation? an AI pass?).
- Standalone-deck addressing/feed treatment (does a deck appear in lists/feeds, or is it a
  side-artifact like the audio reading?).
- Sizing/pagination ownership once we revisit it (reader-driven vs author hints).
